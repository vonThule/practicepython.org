29. Tic Tac Toe Game

This exercise is Part 4 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.

In 3 previous exercises, we built up a few components needed to build a Tic Tac Toe game in Python:

    Draw the Tic Tac Toe game board
    Checking whether a game board has a winner
    Handle a player move from user input

The next step is to put all these three components together to make a two-player Tic Tac Toe game! Your challenge in this exercise is to use the functions from those previous exercises all together in the same program to make a two-player game that you can play with a friend. There are a lot of choices you will have to make when completing this exercise, so you can go as far or as little as you want with it.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

    You should keep track of who won - if there is a winner, show a congratulatory message on the screen.
    If there are no more moves left, don’t ask for the next player’s move!

As a bonus, you can ask the players if they want to play again and keep a running tally of who won more - Player 1 or Player 2.
